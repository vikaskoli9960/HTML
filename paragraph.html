    <p>If your writing a Word document and need to insert placeholder
         text into a template or outline, thereâ€™s an easy way to generate
          sample text. Sure, you can type your own nonsense words to generate
           placeholder text, but Word actually has a built-in function to generate random text.
    </p>
    <p>You can use the rand function to generate random text. To do this,
         move to a new paragraph and type =Rand(). You will get a collection
          of placeholder text. If you need more, you can determine the amount
           of text required by entering the number of paragraphs required 
           in the parentheses, followed by a comma, and the number of sentences
            you would like in each paragraph.</p>
