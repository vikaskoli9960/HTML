        If your writing a Word document <kbd>ctrl + s</kbd> and need to insert<br>
         placeholder text into a template or outline, there’s an easy way<br>
          to generate sample text. Sure, you can type your own nonsense words 
          to generate placeholder text, but Word actually has a built-in functio
          to generate random text.During the 1970s and 1980s, the company shifted
          its focus to new opportunities in the IT and computing industry,
           which was at a nascent stage in India at the time. On 7 June 1977,
            the name of the company changed from Western India Vegetable Produc
             Grid US as a settlement for a botched SAP implementation that an
              2014 audit estimated could cost the company US$1 billion. Wipro
               had been hired as systems integrator in 2010, but errors in the
                rollout, intended to replace an Oracle system, caused serious
                 losses and reputational damage.[19]
        
        In March 2020, Hedera announced that Wipro would be joining their Governing Council, providing decentralized governance to its hashgraph distributed ledger technology.[20]</b></p>
