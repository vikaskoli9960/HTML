        Good morning! Thank you for calling us here at the Reservation Desk!
    This is Chris on the phone, and I'll be more than happy to help you with your inquiry. I'm really sorry you were put on hold, but unfortunately we've had heavy call volume today. But I'm back now, and I can definitely check rates and availability for you. Can we start with some of your dates? Hmm,
                 it looks like your best option is this Friday at 6 PM. Would you like to book this flight?
